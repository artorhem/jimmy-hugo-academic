## Sharing isn't Believing:
Experimental evidence on coarse messaging and belief-formation in fake news.
People frequently share stories on social media with little additional context. I explore how this type of coarse messaging biases receivers' beliefs about the veracity of stories forwarded to them. Using a set of lab experiments in India with ~800 pairs of real-life friends, I collect detailed information on how individuals (sharers) decide which stories to share, and how their friends (receivers) update their beliefs in response. I compare receivers' updates on forwarded stories to their updates on learning the sharer's beliefs directly, and find that receivers significantly overestimate the extent to which sharing decisions reflect sharer's beliefs, and the extent to which sharer's beliefs predict story veracity. Furthermore, receivers exhibit a form of selection neglect - they update identically on shared stories that their friends found credible, and those that their friends didn't find as credible but deemed worthy of sharing anyway (these stories are more likely to be false). Finally, I find that the largest increases in receivers' beliefs occur at the lowest priors, a form of non-bayesian updating that privileges increased belief in false stories. I conclude with implications for aggregate learning, and with counterfactual exercises to identify the relative value of targeting each of these mechanisms.
