I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Economics with two strands of research interests: <br> 1. Social norms, social networks, and belief-formation;<br> 2. Intergenerational persistence of poverty and inequality. 
<br><br>
I am on the economics job market in the 2022â€“2023 academic year and am available for interviews.
